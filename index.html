      <h3>What is NeuroGum?</h3>
      <p>NeuroGum is a functional gum and mint that delivers a refreshing burst of mental clarity and energy through a unique blend of nootropics, natural caffeine, L-theanine, and essential vitamins. Our gum and mints are sugar-free, vegan, and gluten-free, making them a clean and convenient alternative to traditional energy drinks or coffee.</p>

      <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>When you chew NeuroGum or pop a NeuroMint, the active ingredients are absorbed through the mucosal lining in your mouth. This method allows for faster and more efficient absorption compared to traditional methods like drinking coffee or taking pills.</p>

      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li><strong>Caffeine (from green tea):</strong> For a clean, balanced boost of energy.</li>
        <li><strong>L-Theanine:</strong> An amino acid that promotes calm alertness and reduces stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin B6 & B12:</strong> Essential for energy production and brain health.</li>
      </ul>
