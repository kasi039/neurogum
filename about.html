      <h1>The Science of Better Living — One Chew at a Time</h1>
      <p>Welcome to NeuroGum — where innovation meets intention, and energy meets clarity.
        Our journey began with a simple question: What if there were a cleaner, faster, and
        smarter way to fuel your mind? That question sparked a revolution in how people think
        about productivity, wellness, and performance — all from something as small as a
        piece of gum.

      <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
      <img src="./images/neurogum-team.jpg" alt="The NeuroGum team on product development" />
      <p>NeuroGum was born out of necessity. Our co-founders, Kent and Ryan, were driven
        by long days, high-performance demands, and a desire to live better without relying
        on sugary energy drinks or jittery cups of coffee.
        Kent, a former professional athlete, and Ryan, a neuroscience student, realized that
        the traditional ways of staying energized were outdated. They imagined something
        different — something cleaner, faster, and more efficient. With their combined
        knowledge in neuroscience, health, and athletic performance, they created
        NeuroGum: a smart, simple, chewable solution that delivers mental clarity and energy
        in seconds.</p>
