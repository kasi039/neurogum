        <h3>What is NeuroGum?</h3>
        <p>NeuroGum is a functional gum (and mint) designed to enhance your energy, focus, and mental clarity. It’s infused with natural caffeine, L-theanine, and vitamins B6 and B12 to give you a clean, balanced boost without the crash or jitters.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I use NeuroGum or NeuroMints?</h3>
        <p>Just chew or suck on one piece when you need a mental or energy boost. Because of sublingual absorption, it works faster than drinks or pills.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, our products are manufactured in FDA-compliant facilities and tested for purity and potency. The caffeine dosage is equivalent to a small cup of coffee and safe when used as directed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does it take to feel the effects?</h3>
        <p>Because of buccal absorption, you may start to feel effects within 5 to 15 minutes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will I experience a crash like I do with coffee or energy drinks?</h3>
        <p>No. Thanks to the balanced formula of caffeine + L-theanine, you’ll experience a smooth lift without the crash or jitters.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are there any side effects?</h3>
        <p>Side effects are rare. Some may experience caffeine sensitivity like restlessness, mild headaches, or trouble sleeping. Start with one piece to see how your body reacts.</p>
